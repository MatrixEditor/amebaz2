# AmebaZ2 / AmebaZII

Open Source Implementation of OTA and Flash Generation for the AmebaZ2 SDK in Rust

> [!CAUTION]
> This repository is an unofficial implementation based on reverse engineering of the official SDK and previous work from [ltchiptool](https://github.com/libretiny-eu/ltchiptool).

*Documentation and usage information are a work in progress!*

Features:

* Parse OTA and Flash images (w/ extraction support)
* [_**Relink**_](src/amebazii/doc/cmd_ota.md#relinking) existing OTA images back to their compiled application binary (ELF) ðŸŽŠ
* [_**Resign**_](src/amebazii/doc/cmd_ota.md#resigning-firmware-files) existing OTA images using custom keys. ðŸŽ‰
* Build a partition table and system data partition


Documentation for CLI has moved to [amebazii/doc](src/amebazii/doc/) and general API docs are avaiable on Github-Pages [here >>](https://matrixeditor.github.io/amebaz2/amebazii/).
